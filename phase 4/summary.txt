and supporting considerations

Contributions named: FA25_Sec501_Tea18_collaboration.pdf


Design decisions:

Rolling resistance changes with wheel radius

weight of chassis and strength of chassis (must withstand loads applied)

chassis options: 3 types of material

Cost modeling with get_cost_rover and get_cost_edl

motor options: 6 types of motors

battery options: 6 different battery packs

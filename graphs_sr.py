"""Create a py-file script called graphs_sr.py that is similar to graphs_motor.py EXCEPT that it uses the
speed, torque, and power of the speed reducer output shaft (the motor shaft now is the input to the
speed reducer; your graphs should be of the torque, speed, and power of the speed reducer output). As
in the previous case, please label your axes properly.
